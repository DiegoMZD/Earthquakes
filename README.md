# Earthquakes

I live in a seismic zone, in the south of Peru (Arequipa), here it is very common to have tremors, and when there are more tremors than "normal", older people say that a big earthquake is coming. I have researched about foreshocks as a warning of a large earthquake, but studies indicate that although some large earthquakes in history had some foreshocks, no evidence has been found that from foreshocks it is possible to predict the occurrence of a large earthquake, nor the magnitude of the earthquake.
As part of my training as a data scientist, I decided to do a small project that would allow me to do more research on this interesting topic, practice some of the skills I have learned, and learn some new ones.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is "All the Earthquakes Dataset : from 1990-2023" located in Kaggle. The Kaggle page of the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/the-ultimate-earthquake-dataset-from-1990-2023/data
